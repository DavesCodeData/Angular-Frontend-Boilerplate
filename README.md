# Davids-Website

This is a work in progress but Angular CLI makes the work go a lot faster.

Hi, I am creaing this website to display to recruiters in the feild of programming my growing talents in coding.

This is the source code for a website I am developing. Here you will find explanations on how I organized and coded this website. Followed by how I set up a nodejs server for the back end and you will be able to see my SQL commands for my postgresql connection. I will have pictures and visuals explaning my code. Then I will begin covering machine learning algorithums I have created and have screen shots going over my code for tensorflows. Finally, I will finish by explaining how I coded my video games and have a short explanation of my Blender creations that I made for the video game developments. Thanks for reading!

To run this development platfrom for my website follow these instructions

Step 1: After creating a copy of this repository and opening it type in the terminal: npm install -g @angular/cli 

If you don't know how to open the terminal hit ctrl + ` and it will open.

Step 2: Run the development on your device by typing in the terminal: ng build

The development portion of the frontend of you project should now be working.

Step 3: Go to localhost://4200

You can now view the website and start making your own adjustments.

When you develop what something you like you can create a full stack development with a Node server.

Go to https://github.com/DavesCodeData/Node-Boilerplate.git and follow the README.md file to create a fullstack deployment.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
