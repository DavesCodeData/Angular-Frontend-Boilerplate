# Davids-Website

This is a work in progress but Angular CLI makes the work go a lot faster.

Hi, I am creaing this website to display to recruiters in the feild of programming my growing talents in coding.

This is the source code for a website I am developing. Here you will find explanations on how I organized and coded this website. Followed by how I set up a nodejs server for the back end and you will be able to see my SQL commands for my postgresql connection. I will have pictures and visuals explaning my code. Then I will begin covering machine learning algorithms I have created and have screen shots going over my code for tensorflows. Finally, I will finish by explaining how I coded my video games and have a short explanation of my Blender creations that I made for the video game developments. Thanks for reading!

To run this development platfrom for my website follow these instructions

Step 1: After creating a copy of this repository and opening it type in the terminal: npm install -g @angular/cli 

If you don't know how to open the terminal hit ctrl + ` and it will open.

Step 2: Run the development on your device by typing in the terminal: ng build

The development portion of the frontend of you project should now be working.

Step 3: Go to localhost://4200

You can now view the website and start making your own adjustments.

When you develop something you like you can create a full stack development with a Node server.

Go to https://github.com/DavesCodeData/Node-Boilerplate.git and follow the README.md file to create a fullstack deployment.
