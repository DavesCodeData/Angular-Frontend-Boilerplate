# Davids-Website

This is a work in progress but Angular CLI makes the work go a lot faster.

Hi, I am creaing this website to display to recruiters in the feild of programming my growing talents in coding.

This is the source code for a website I am developing. Here you will find explanations on how I organized and coded this website. Followed by how I set up a nodejs server for the back end and you will be able to see my SQL commands for my postgresql connection. I will have pictures and visuals explaning my code. Then I will begin covering machine learning algorithums I have created and have screen shots going over my code for tensorflows. Finally, I will finish by explaining how I coded my video games and have a short explanation of my Blender creations that I made for the video game developments. Thanks for reading!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
