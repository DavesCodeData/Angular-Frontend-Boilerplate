    <p>Here are screen shots of my Angular application I'll explain how my code works with visuals on the left and text on the right.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>Here you can see the names of the files I have set up</h1>

        <p>
          Let's start with what is Angular. Specifically, Angular CLI. 
          This is a piece of software that uses the Type Script langauge to code a website.
          Angular CLI comes with lots of neat modules to make coding easier once you know
          how to use them in your Type Script.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you can see my organizational pattern. I have my website organized into components, services, models
          and run them in the app files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets take a look at the app portion of the code and I'll explain how my 
          initial set up works!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/app.module.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1> Getting started now lets look at the modules</h1>
        <p>On lines 5-12 I have created all of these modules to do specific tasks. We will go over each of them.
          The modules above line 5 are imports from the .angular file package specifically the angular-webpack package.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imported Angular modules such as HttpClientModule are incredibly useful and necessary in creating
          a full stack development. This is a crucail module to import because, it is what allows
          us to connect this application to my Node.js server which is another program I created for handling the restAPI's
          get, post, put and delete commands. But we'll get to that later.
        </p>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/app-routing.module.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>Next we will look at routing</h1>
        <p>Routing works by creating paths to follow so that the application can run through the approprate components
          and from there run my CSS, HTML, and Type Script files in the correct order to display content for you to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have noticed that the HomeComponent does not have the name of any component in its path and has been left blank!
          This is entirly on purpose. Leaving the path to your home page blank is a convention of setting the websites display to the 
          HTML and CSS of the home component for whenever there is no specified path. But there is a little more to this in that the
          app needs specification as to what the default view in app.component.html will display.
        </p>
        <p>
          So lets look at that next!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/app.component.html.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>The apps html file</h1>
        <p>
          This might not look like much but really this is the first html file of many to be read by the computer.
          Here we set up the design of the website in that the header component will be displayed on top and the
          footer component will be displayed on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you might be wondering "what is router-outlets?" And the answer is that these outlets are my components.
          Each component has it's own html file that uses CSS for position and gets it's materials either from Angular materials
          or through assests I created and placed in the assets folder such as the images you are seeing on the left. The specifics as to how these files are read will come from each 
          components unique component.ts file and the configuration of the component will come from each components unique component.spec.ts file.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here lets take a look at the first selection of this HTML file which is the header.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/header.component.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>The header component</h1>
        <p>
          This might not seem like much at first glance but here we are now importing a wonderful mechanic of Angular CLI.
          We are now useing @angular/core which gives us the type decorator where we are creating a class with a name that we
          select on. Do you recognize app-header? That is the name that we can be selected by in the app.component.html file 
          and now run my headers HTML file and CSS file for this component.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind it is finally time to start seeing the app-routing.module.ts file in action by taking
          a look at the headers HTML file.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/header.component.html.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>The headers HTML with router links in action</h1>
        <p>
          Now we are finally looking at the many clickable links in the application. Here we can now see my first use of
          classes and routerLinks. You will notice on the routerLink for Home as discussed is purposfully left blank and 
          I've added a comment to help explain the choice of routing. Here you can see that the different classes envlope 
          different aspect of the HTML file. The reason for this is to make positioning easier in my CSS file.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here it would be a good idea to look over the use of CSS in my application before following one of the routes
          so that you know how I am position my materials.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/header.component.css.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>Positioning with CSS</h1>
        <p>
          Here you might recognize that many of the names with the periods in front of them are the same names as the
          classes in my HTML file. That's because, this is a CSS file and I am using the classes of my HTML file for positioning and color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you know how I position the content I want to display from my HTML file you have seen in large part how 
          an Angular component works. There is a little bit more to this but we'll get to that later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you've got the gist of my program lets follow one of the routes in my header.component.html file and see where
          the home route takes us.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/home.component.html.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>Home Component this is what you are currently viewing</h1>
        <p>
          The routerLink for Home in the head.component.html file has brought us to the home component.
          For now the home.component.spec.ts and home.component.ts are the default code the Angular application has provided
          so it's nothing new. The most prudent thing to show you is my html file. This is the largest html file of the website
          and by far the most complicated. Here there are a lot more classes some new names like href, img src, and alt these are
          unique attributes given for a variaty of reasons. The href contains the URL to my GitHub and acts as a hyperlink. The img src=
          is meant to direct an element in this case a png file to my src file and from there follow a route to the png file. The alt 
          indicates that the image is a key part of the webpage and that none visual browsers will indicate the lack of display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The class "content" manly repeats to create the flow steps showing how I created this website.
          From here lets look at how I positioned all of this by looking at the home components CSS file.
        </p>

          <h1>Ursina Island</h1>
          <p>
            This is my intro screen to a computer video game I have created. 
            The game is coded in Python3 and runs on the Ursina game engine.
            Ursina is a very low level engine with no UI. I picked this engine because, it would require the maximum amount of coding 
            and therefore would be a great place to practice my Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            The graphics of the game may look odd. That's because,
            I created the 3D objects in Blender as I also wanted to learn how to do 3D modeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets first look at how the game is launched.

              This is where it all begins!

            <p>
              For this project I am running my source code in Microsoft Visual Studios CE rather then Visula Studios Code.
              This application is typically used by corperations to develop there software and it can handle much larger
              projects then VS Code.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this file I organized the initiation of the games code.
            </p>
            <p>
              From here we will go to the intro.py file that displays the home screen and asks the user if they would like to 
              start the game.

          <p>
            This is the code that displays the Main Menu scene you saw as the first screen shot of my video game creation.
            Here I begin to use some of Ursina's API. The Button() method is part of Ursian and simply requires the outline
            you see below. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Intro screen if you click Start will then run the level.py file which contains most of the code. Lets 
            look at that next.

          Here is the bulk of my code. I'll run you through how it works and this will take a bigger explanation then anything so far. 
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you will see the set up for the imports some of which are Ursina's API modules and others are my own creation. 
          I'll cover them as we encounter them in my code. Then you will see the blue print for how the objects of
          the level class are created by the definitions assigned to my Blender objects.
          Once, the parameters for the objects are defined we can begin using them.
